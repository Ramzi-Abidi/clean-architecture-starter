## Key Principles

1. **Independence of Frameworks**
   - Avoid tight coupling with frameworks.

2. **Testability**
   - Ensure easy unit testing.

3. **Independent of UI**
   - Keep UI independent of core logic.

4. **Independent of Database**
   - Keep business logic independent of the database.

5. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Separate layers of responsibility.

6. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions, not implementations.
